# DDM_simulation

this is a simple Jupyter notebook that runs a single decision DDM simulation and then animates the results as a gif (no distributions collected -- but this should be easy)

to run the code one needs following 
numpy
imageio (for the the gif)
random


To understand all the parameters that can be adjsted one is referred to check: https://www.med.upenn.edu/longding1/javascript/DDM_LongDing.html and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2474742/

to run the simulation just update the path such that your files will get saved to the right place
